title: "El Cerritoâ€™s Pension Debt: A Growing Crisis"

I'm a data analyst based in El Cerrito, California, focused on using public data to shine a light on local government issues. Most of my work examines El Cerritoâ€™s finances, but Iâ€™ve also analyzed fire department performance and public safety metrics.

This blog is meant to show how data analysis can inform â€” and reform â€” public policy. Each post will highlight key takeaways from my longer reports.

## ðŸ“‰ CalPERS Pension Debt: El Cerritoâ€™s Crisis

El Cerritoâ€™s **CalPERS Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL)** has reached crisis levels.

Back in 2017, Stanford researcher **Joe Nation** warned that CalPERS pension costs would soon crowd out essential local services. El Cerrito did not act â€” and that warning has become reality.

Just last month, the City Council could not afford:

- A replacement fire engine  
- Required fire safety gear  
- Full repairs for the cityâ€™s much-loved swimming pool

Meanwhile, El Cerrito made its **minimum required UAL payment** to CalPERS:  
ðŸ’¸ **$7,763,945**

The city has always paid the minimum â€” and because CalPERS uses **overly optimistic assumptions**, the debt has ballooned.

Sometimes, one graph says it all. Hereâ€™s the chart I created in R using `ggplot2`:
