Two separate reports analyzing fire department incidents in 2024:  
(1) a focused study of **El Cerrito & Kensington**, and  
(2) a comparative study of **El Cerrito/Kensington vs. Richmond**.

---

## Part 1 — El Cerrito & Kensington (2024)
**Key takeaways:**
- El Cerrito’s west-side station is fastest; Kensington shows slower times (likely due to hilly terrain and narrow streets).  
- Response-time differences are statistically significant.

- El Cerrito units respond far more often into Richmond than the reverse (mutual aid imbalance, Table E4).  
- Kensington continues to show the slowest response times, while Richmond is faster on average (Tables E5/E6).
