After months of public records review, data cleaning, and advanced analysis in RStudio, I’ve published a new report on **fire and emergency activity** in **El Cerrito and Kensington**. The findings offer insights into how our fire department is responding to local needs and where resources may be best directed.

## 🔥 Key Takeaways

- **Station 51**, near El Cerrito Plaza, handles **about 4× the workload** of the other stations.
- **Medical emergencies (Code 321)** are the largest single category — making up **over one-third** of all calls.
- **Incident hotspots** cluster around the **Del Norte and Plaza BART stations**.
- **Response times are fastest in El Cerrito West**, slower in **El Cerrito East and Kensington**.
- No strong **seasonal variation** — incident volume stays relatively stable month-to-month.

## 📊 Why This Matters

Understanding where and when emergencies happen — and how long it takes to respond — is critical for:

- Staffing decisions  
- Resource allocation  
- Public safety planning  
- Budget priorities

I used real incident records from the **El Cerrito–Kensington Fire Department**, obtained via a **Public Records Act request**. Using mapping tools and statistical models, I identified clear regional trends and workload differences that can support more informed policy conversations.

## 📍 What’s in the Report?

- Heat maps of emergency incident locations  
- Incident counts by year, region, and type  
- Response time statistics by city and neighborhood  
- Total apparatus hours by station and city  
- ANOVA and post hoc tests comparing response patterns

## 🧠 My Goal

As a data analyst with a background in mathematics, real estate, and marketing, I believe that civic data should be **understandable, transparent, and actionable**. This blog is part of my effort to bring useful insights to light — and to demonstrate how public records and modern analytics can work together.
