Two complementary views of the same dataset: **workload by station** and **response times by region**.

## Part 1 — Workload by Station
**Key takeaway:** Richmond stations handle a much heavier average workload than El Cerrito/Kensington stations.

> Note: In Table E3 (stations), **shaded rows (51, 52, 55)** are El Cerrito Fire Department.

## Part 2 — Response Times
**Key takeaway:** Response times differ by geography: **El Cerrito West** is fastest; **Kensington** is slower (terrain/roads likely factors). Differences are statistically significant.
