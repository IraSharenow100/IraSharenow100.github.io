<h2>📉 CalPERS Pension Debt: El Cerrito’s Crisis</h2>

<p>This is my first blog post!</p>

<p>I’m a data analyst based in El Cerrito, California, focused on using public data to shine a light on local government issues. Most of my work examines El Cerrito’s finances, but I’ve also analyzed fire department performance and public safety metrics.</p>

<p>This blog is meant to show how data analysis can inform — and reform — public policy. Each post will highlight key takeaways from my longer reports.</p>

<p>El Cerrito’s <strong>CalPERS Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL)</strong> has reached crisis levels.</p>

<p>Back in 2017, Stanford researcher <strong>Joe Nation</strong> warned that CalPERS pension costs would soon crowd out essential local services. El Cerrito did not act — and that warning has become reality.</p>

<p>Just last month, the City Council could not afford:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A replacement fire engine</li>
  <li>Required fire safety gear</li>
  <li>Full repairs for the city’s much-loved swimming pool</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, El Cerrito made its <strong>minimum required UAL payment</strong> to CalPERS:<br>
💸 <strong>$7,763,945</strong></p>

<p>The city has always paid the minimum — and because CalPERS uses overly optimistic assumptions, the debt has ballooned.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes, one graph says it all. Here’s the chart I created in R using <code>ggplot2</code>:</strong></p>
