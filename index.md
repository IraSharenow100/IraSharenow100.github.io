# Fire Department Incident Analysis (El Cerrito, Kensington & Richmond, 2024)

Two complementary views of the same dataset: **workload by station** and **response times by region**.

## Part 1 — Workload by Station
**Key takeaway:** Richmond stations handle a much heavier average workload than El Cerrito/Kensington stations.

## Part 2 — Response Times
**Key takeaway:** Response times differ by geography: El Cerrito West is fastest; Kensington is slower (terrain/roads likely factors).
