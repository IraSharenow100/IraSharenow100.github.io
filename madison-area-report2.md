This is the second in my multi-part series analyzing Madison-area single-family home sales.  
While **Report 1** focused only on the City of Madison, **Report 2** expands the scope to include surrounding suburban communities.

**Files:**
- [📄 PDF Report](proj2_mad_area_hist.pdf)  
- [📝 R Markdown](proj2_mad_area_hist.Rmd)

**Key Highlights:**
- Suburban homes average **200–300 sq ft larger** than Madison homes  
- Suburban homes command a consistent **price premium**  
- Madison maintains higher **price per square foot**, reflecting location convenience  
- Both markets show similar **long-term appreciation trends**
